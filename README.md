## Step 1. Generation of the Verilog Code using AI Generated Tool

### Using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/):
I started off with asking ChatGPT to design various complicated and innovative counter. It gave a Fractional Counter, a Adaptive Counting Window Counter, a Self-Modifying Counter, a Bloom Filter Counter and various other counters. </br>
Complete conversation can be found here: https://chat.openai.com/share/87d72c4a-db14-4f90-97f6-ba1bad512cba.</br>
Here are a few illustrations:
#### 1. Question Asked. Please create an innovative counter  of completely new type
Answer:</br>

### Using [Bard](https://bard.google.com/)

**However, based on the above answers, we finalized building up a Bloom Filter Counter over the results given by ChatGPT!**

## Step 2. Cloning the Caravel Repo:
Forking the [Caravel User Project Repo](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project) and cloning the copy.</br>
```git clone https://github.com/Eyantra698Sumanto/caravel_dvsdfossbfc```</br>
Some points on Caravel by ChatGPT:</br>
![image](https://github.com/Eyantra698Sumanto/caravel_dvsdfossbfc/assets/58599984/9e95e535-26ba-45a4-96e4-afbfd776fb4f)

## Step 3. Embedding the Verilog file to the User_Project_Wrapper

For simplicity, the above [Bloom Counter Generated by ChatGPT](https://github.com/Eyantra698Sumanto/caravel_dvsdfossbfc/blob/main/verilog/rtl/dvsdfossbfc.v) was Embedded in User_Project_Wrapper.
</br>
Here is the code snippet:</br>
```
assign io_oeb[15:0]=16'b1111_1111_1111_1111;
assign io_oeb[`MPRJ_IO_PADS-1:16]=0;
assign io_out=1;
assign la_data_out=1;
assign wbs_dat_o=1;
assign user_irq=1;
reg [15:0] counter;
  reg [15:0] bloomFilter;
always @(posedge user_clock2 or posedge io_in[0]) begin
    if (io_in[0]) begin
      counter <= 16'b0000_0000_0000_0000;
      bloomFilter <= 16'b0000_0000_0000_0000;
    end else if (io_in[9]) begin
      if (bloomFilter[io_in[8:1]]) begin
        // Bloom filter indicates that the input data is likely already counted
        counter <= counter;
      end else begin
        // Bloom filter indicates that the input data is likely not counted
        counter <= counter + 1;
        bloomFilter[io_in[8:1]] <= 1;
      end
    end
  end
  assign io_out[31:16]=counter;
```
</br>
The modified code is available [HERE](https://github.com/Eyantra698Sumanto/caravel_dvsdfossbfc/blob/main/verilog/rtl/user_project_wrapper.v).

## Step 4. Changes made to the config.json

There were various errors as depicted in the actions page [HERE](https://github.com/Eyantra698Sumanto/caravel_dvsdfossbfc/actions) during the flow.</br>
The new updated final json file can be found [HERE](https://github.com/Eyantra698Sumanto/caravel_dvsdfossbfc/blob/main/openlane/user_project_wrapper/config.json)

## Step 5. Run make openlane

Executing the following commands to run:</br>
```cd caravel_dvsdfossbfc```</br>
```make openlane```.</br>

There were various issues which were debugged stepwise.</br>

Some of them are present [HERE](https://github.com/Eyantra698Sumanto/caravel_dvsdfossbfc/blob/main/openlane/user_project_wrapper/config.json).</br>

Also, the [OpenLane issues](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane/issues) page helped.,/br>
## Step 6. Debugging with ChatGPT

Here are some debugging of TCL scripts using the ChatGPT.</br>

ChatGPT trying to correct the scripts:</br>

## Step 7. OpenLane stuck at Detailed Route
The flow stuck at the Detailed Route due to huge consumpsion of RAM(>6GB).</br>

The Repo was shifted to a Remote Desktop cloud provided by eFabless and it worked.

## Step 8. Setting up in the cloud
The following steps help to set up and run OpenLane again:</br>
https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project/blob/main/docs/source/index.rst#section-quickstart
## Step 9. Flow Successful

After around 2 hours the flow was successful.</br>

## Step 10. Compressing the files

The files greater than 100MB were compressed using the `make compress` command.</br>

## Step 11. Uploaded the files on Github

The files were pushed using the ```git add```  and ```git push``` commands through the SSH.</br>

## Step 12. MPW-Precheck Submitted to Caravel

## Step 13. Tapeout Submitted to MPW-PreCheck

## Step 14. Final Submission

## Step 15. Comments made by ChatGPT on the repository
